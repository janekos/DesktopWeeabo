If you search for something.

Usage:
  * You can search for animes in the search view and from there you can save each entry that shows up. To save them you just have to select the which view they should be in and the program does everything else for you.
    * It creates a folder in your documents folder and saves your selections in xml in there.
    * If you have previously saved any animes then it takes their user set variables into consideration before displaying the final list.
  * Every view has its own special variables, though they are not strictly required.
    * To Watch view has a Watch priority, which let's you set vurrent animes watching priority which is sortable.
    * Watched view has inputs for your personal review and score for future reference. Personal score is sortable.
    * Watching view has a Current episode variable, which lets you set the episode that you currently are on. Or if you stopped this anime then you know where you stopped.
    * Dropped view has an input for your personal drop reason.
  * In settings you can stop the program from making backups and change the whole programs color.
  * About view is just some mundane info about the creator and the program itself.
  
Extra info:
  * No install just run the program.
  * The program was written on win 7 and tested on win10 and win7. Win10 does not seem to require any additional .net packages. Not sure about Win7 yet.
